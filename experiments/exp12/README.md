# exp12

Objectives:

1. Build with extern const linking of firmware blob and PDS table

2. Implement free to go with alloc (instead of letting allocations leak)

3. Implement SPI on Feather M4 GPIO in Arduino IDE


## Console Log 1 (clang stdout)

This uses the zero-buf branch of samblenny/wfx-fullMAC-driver at commit
[54842b4](https://github.com/samblenny/wfx-fullMAC-driver/commit/54842b4931d10a7119db337ba30ed2ff5dd6d959)

See [console_log_1.txt](console_log_1.txt)


## PDS File Setup

The purpose of a PDS file is to configure the WF200 radio and GPIO. For the
BRD8022A "WF200 Wi-Fi EXP Board" evaluation board from Silicon Laboratories,
there is a header file for the pre-defined PDS at
https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wfx-fullMAC-tools/blob/master/PDS/brd8022a_pds.h

To get the PDS header file, do this, starting from `exp11/`:
```
cd ../
mkdir -p wfx-fullMAC-tools/PDS
cd wfx-fullMAC-tools/PDS
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SiliconLabs/wfx-fullMAC-tools/master/PDS/brd8022a_pds.h
```
